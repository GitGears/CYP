# CYP17A1 project 

This repository is established for the aim of reproducibility of the CYP17A1 project.

The description of the files: 

CDK_CYP_962.csv, CYP_AcidBase.csv, KlekotaRothCount_CYP_962.csv,KlekotaRoth_CYP_962.csv, PubChem_CYP_962.csv,SubstructureCount_CYP_962.csv, Substructure_CYP_962.csv files are the molecular fingerprint files calculated for the 962 molecules. 

Pictures named with 'AD' represent the applicability domains of the nonsteroidal QSAR models

Pictures named with 'cm' represent the confusion matrices of all the models

File with name examplified by 'model1-y-train-pred.csv' means the detailed list of training set molecules, their true bioactivities and predicted bioactivities. Other files named with 'pred' abide by the same rules of definition. 

CYP279_steroidal.csv is the steroidal molecules, CYP683_nonsteroidal.csv is the nonsteroidal molecules

Files with 'admet' in their names are the physicochemical propertries form for chemical space visualization.
